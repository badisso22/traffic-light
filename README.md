# Traffic Light System Project

## Overview
This project simulates a traffic light system with two sides. Each side has three lights (Red, Green, Orange) and uses counters to manage light timings. LEDs represent the lights, and 7-segment displays show the counters.

## Features
- Each side alternates between Red, Green, and Orange lights.
- **Red Light:** Counter counts up to 30 seconds.
- **Green Light:** Counter counts up to 20 seconds.
- **Orange Light:** Counter counts up to 10 seconds.
- When one side shows Red, the other side alternates between Green and Orange, and vice versa.

## Requirements
- LEDs for light simulation (Red, Green, Orange).
- 7-segment displays for counters.
- A circuit design platform (e.g., Logisim or equivalent).

## How It Works
1. **Red Light:** When a side displays Red, the counter runs for 30 seconds while the opposite sideâ€™s counter remains at zero.
2. **Green and Orange Lights:** The opposite side alternates between Green (20 seconds) and Orange (10 seconds).
3. Synchronization ensures one side displays Red while the other side operates Green/Orange.

## Usage
- Design and implement the circuit using LEDs and 7-segment displays.
- Ensure proper synchronization of counters and light colors.
- Test the timing and transitions to match the specifications.
